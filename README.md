 * [Ethereum Name Service](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/137) is a proposed protocol that provides flexible resolution of short, human-readable names to service and resource identifiers.
 * [Evernym](http://www.evernym.com/) is developing the first "self-sovereign identity platform" on a permissioned distributed ledger called [Sovrin](http://www.sovrin.org/), which is dedicated solely to identity, and it is fully open source (FOSS). Multiple white papers explain the the ideas and technologies behind it. A [podcast](http://bigfintechmedia.com/Podcast/blockchain-and-the-universal-identity) is available that explains the concept of "universal identity".
 * At Ethereum’s DEVCON ONE conference, a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpaTOvAhLR4) on blockchain, digital identity, and public key infrastructure was given.
 * [Bitnation](https://bitnation.co/) seeks to establish the concept of “world citizenship” through identity registration on the blockchain. The project is collaborating with the Estonian e-Residency program and also has a focus on offering ["blockchain emergency IDs"](https://refugees.bitnation.co/) to refugees.
 * Linux foundation [hyper ledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) project looking to develop a cross-industry open standard with many big companies participating.
 * [ID2020](http://id2020.org/) seeks to provide every child born after 2020 with a self sovereign digital identity, which helps reduce risks of trafficking and drive digital inclusion.
 * [Shocard](https://shocard.com/) is an early stage company developing an “identity platform” built on blockchain.
 * A [research team](http://mm.aueb.gr/) at Athens University of Economics and Business is working on “information-centric” networking and is exploring the use of blockchain technology for “content names”. 
 * The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is [funding](https://blog.aniljohn.com/2015/12/federal-gov-funds-for-identity-r-and-d.html) research on the "Applicability of Blockchain Technology to Privacy Respecting Identity Management"
 * An MIT [paper](http://web.media.mit.edu/~guyzys/data/ZNP15.pdf) about "Decentralizing Privacy: Using Blockchain to Protect Personal Data".
 * An Ethereum [blog post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/01/15/privacy-on-the-blockchain/) about "Privacy on the Blockchain", including some thoughts about identity systems.
 * [Jolocom](http://jolocom.com/) is developing applications for everyone to own their personal digital identity, using linked data and blockchain technologies.
 * [Danube Tech](http://danubetech.com/) is collaborating with several other efforts to build blockchain-based identifier registration infrastructure.
 * [Scuttlebot](https://scuttlebot.io/) is a "blockchain identity" protocol avoiding a [singleton-based approach](https://scuttlebot.io/more/articles/design-challenge-avoid-centralization-and-singletons.html). It embraces subjectivity over consensus, e.g. each identity can publish messages that map their favorite pet name mappings for themselves and others. [Patchwork](https://ssbc.github.io/patchwork/) is a user-facing decentralized messaging and sharing app based on Scuttlebot.
 * Startup Cambridge Blockchain is working on an [Identity Blockchain](http://cambridge-blockchain.com/alpha_genesis_block.html) for validating secure digital identity documents, processing electronic signatures, and recording transactions.
 * [Proof-of-Individuality](http://proofofindividuality.online/) addresses the challenge to prove that a person only has one account within a system, without sacrificing the advantages of anonymity/pseudonymity. See [here](https://medium.com/@unlisted/anti-sybil-protocol-using-virtual-pseudonym-parties-10276fcf3b20) for a draft implementation using "virtual pseudonym parties".
 * [Regis](http://regis.nu/) is a platform that makes it easy to build, deploy, and manage decentralized registries on the Ethereum blockchain.
 * [SingleID](http://singleid.com/) An app that allows you to be in control of their online identity. It provides safe logins with no registration and no password.
 * [IDKeys](https://idkeys.net/) is a distributed global identity system that registers cryptographic public keys on the Stellar blockchain.
 * [CheapID](http://guptaoption.com/cheapid/) is a digital identity standard designed for use in conflicted environment like those many refugees or disaster victims may find themselves in.
 * [DIDs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z-9jX4PEWtyRFD5fEyyzEnWK_0ir0no1JJLuRu8O9Gs/) (Decentralized Identifiers) are a new type of identifier intended for digital identity that is "self-sovereign", i.e, fully under the control of the identity owner. DIDs resolve to DDOs (DID descriptor objects) and can be registered in different blockchains (using different "methods").
 * A [research project](https://github.com/jolocom/WebID-Ethereum-Integration) on registering WebIDs on the Ethereum blockchain, to be used for Linked Data and Solid.
 * An [article](http://www.gsma.com/personaldata/the-relationship-between-blockchain-and-digital-identity) by the GSMA about the relationship between blockchain and identity.
 * A snapshot of the [identity landscape](https://oneworldidentity.com/2017/01/31/one-world-identity-defragments-disparate-identity-industry-landscape/) by oneworldidentity.com.
